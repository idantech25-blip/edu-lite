**ANN** — AI-powered EdTech Platform

About ANN

ANN is an AI-driven EdTech platform built with Flutter. It aims to revolutionize assessment workflows for teachers by enabling them to:

- Snap or upload answer sheets
- Automatically grade submissions using AI
- Instantly generate results
- Support hybrid marking: mark all scripts online or up to 50 scripts offline (helpful in areas with limited connectivity)

This project is still in its early stages and is being designed to be scalable, teacher-friendly, and suitable for real classroom use.

## School Pilot Programs
We’ve received encouraging feedback from teachers at various schools, including:

- FAANS
- UCIDSS
- Blue Bells

Early surveys suggest a high level of interest and enthusiasm among educators.

## Tech Ecosystem
ANN is integrated with a companion Next.js web application (currently under development). This web platform supports role-based school management and connects to ANN via a shared backend.
